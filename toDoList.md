# TOP priority
- sulfid burn bugged when ship has no shields

# High priority


- update interface so player can see angle of weapons

- more organised shop (which items are avionics/shields, etc.)

# Low priority
- -x% resources after death

- upgrade asteroids textures

- draw fire with fire object so anything can be set on fire? or separate burn methods in every enemy

- give sulfids angry status after taking damage (or at 50% hp?)



# Content ideas
- charge weapon, then shoot

- anti asteroid shockwave as secondary

- AoE mine like secondary

- flamethrower



# Done

- *(sulfid) homing enemies*

- *nerf mining cannon*

- *[probably fixed] bug where 1 enemy remain but is not seen on map (maybe caused by killing 2 enemies in 1 tick?)*
